### Updating / Saving / Persisting an instance

Now lets change some values and save changes to the database... There are two ways to do that:

```js
// way 1
task.title = 'a very different title now'
task.save().success(function() {})

// way 2
task.updateAttributes({
  title: 'a very different title now'
}).success(function() {})
```

Since `v1.4.1` it's also possible to define which attributes should be saved when calling `save`. This is useful when you set attributes based on a previously defined object. E.g. if you get the values of an object via a form of a web app. Furthermore this is used internally for `updateAttributes`. This is how it looks like:

```js
task.title = 'foooo'
task.description = 'baaaaaar'
task.save(['title']).success(function() {
 // title will now be 'foooo' but description is the very same as before
})
```
