## Getting started with Heroku | Getting started

Before we can roll out any software on the Heroku cluster, we need to sign up and have to connect our development environment. Here are the most basic steps:

* [Sign up](https://api.heroku.com/signup/devcenter) for a Heroku account.
* [Install](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) the Heroku Toolbelt. This tool will let you create applications and is a handy way to configure them on the command line.
* Use the new binary to login. Run the following command on command line: `heroku login`

And that's it. You should now be able to do things like `heroku apps`. This should list all applications you've currently created on the Heroku cluster. If you've just created a new account, this should show you an empty list. [You can get further information about the registration process here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart).
