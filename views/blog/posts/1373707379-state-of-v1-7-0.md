Here is a list of features that are available in the current version of `1.7.0`:

#### [DEPENDENCIES] Upgraded validator for IPv6 support

The [validator](https://github.com/chriso/node-validator) plugin has been updated to `1.1.1`. Part of the new version is the possibility to check for proper IPv6 addresses. You can use it like this:

```js
Sequelize.define('model', {
  ip: {
    type:     Sequelize.STRING,
    validate: {
      isIPv6: true
    }
  }
})
```

#### [DEPENDENCIES] replaced underscore by lodash

In order to improve performance of the library, we replaced [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) with the faster drop-in-replacement [lodash](http://lodash.com/). You can access it via the already existing way `Sequelize.Utils._`.

#### [FEATURE] Validate a model before it gets saved

Many people requested, that the model needs to be validated before it gets saved. This is now the case. So whenever the `save` method gets called on an object, the model is validated and the `error` callback is triggered if the model isn't valid:

```js
sequelize.define('user', {
  username: {
    type:     Sequelize.STRING,
    validate: {
      notEmpty: true,
      notNull:  true
    }
  }
}).create({
  username: ''
}).error(function(errors) {
  console.log(errors) // { username: [ 'String is empty' ] }
})
```

#### [FEATURE] Schematics

It is now possible to create schemas for postgres respectively to prefix table names for sqlite and mysql. That means that you can now define tables in different scopes:

```js
var User   = sequelize.define('user', { username: Sequelize.STRING })
  , wpUser = User.schema('wordpress', '_')

sequelize.createSchema('wordpress').success(function() {
  sequelize.sync().success(function() {
    // Sequelize will now create the following tables: `wordpress_users`
  })
})
```

#### [FEATURE] Foreign key constraints

It is now possible to define foreign keys to connect tables / models with each other. The following snippet connects the `Post` model with the `Author` model.

```js
var Author = sequelize.define('author', { first_name: Sequelize.STRING })
var Post   = sequelize.define('post', {
  title:    Sequelize.STRING,
  authorId: {
    type:          Sequelize.INTEGER,
    references:    Author,
    referencesKey: "id"
  }
})

Author.hasMany(Post)
Post.belongsTo(Author)
```

Also we can now define reactions of certain events. E.g. what should happen to the associated objects after a `delete` operation, etc. This is the way to do it:

```js
var Author = sequelize.define('author', { first_name: Sequelize.STRING })
var Post   = sequelize.define('post', {
  title: Sequelize.STRING,
  authorId: {
    type:          Sequelize.INTEGER,
    references:    'authors',
    referencesKey: 'id',
    onDelete:      'cascade'
  }
})

Author.hasMany(Post)
Post.belongsTo(Author)

sequelize.sync().success(function() {
  new Sequelize.Utils.QueryChainer()
    .add(Author.create({ first_name: 'John' }))
    .add(Post.create({ title: 'news' }))
    .add(Post.create({ title: 'milestone reached' }))
    .run()
    .success(function(results) {
      var author    = results[0]
        , news      = results[1]
        , milestone = results[2]

      author.setPosts([ news, milestone ]).success(function() {
        author.destroy()
        /*
          At this point, you won't find any authors and posts in the database anymore,
          as we have dropped the only author and due to the cascade option every related
          posts of him.
        */
      })
    })
})
```

#### [FEATURE] Support for bulk insert/update/delete

In order to minimize the number of SQL requests while creating/updating/deleting a bunch of entries, we introduced bulk support.

This is how creation of multiple instances is possible while just triggering a single SQL statement:

```js
var User = sequelize.define('User', { name: Sequelize.STRING })

User.sync({ force: true }).success(function() {
  var userData = [
    { name: 'John' },
    { name: 'Jane' },
    { name: 'Pete' }
  ]

  User.bulkCreate(userData).success(function() {
    // We just created 3 users with just a single SQL statement <3
  })
})
```

In order to update a bunch of entries we can utilize the `update` method:

```js
User.update({ name: 'Foo' }, '`name` LIKE "J%"').success(function() {
  // All users thats name used to start with "J" is now called "Foo" :)
})
```

Last but not least we can delete all entries matching certain criteria:

```js
User.bulkCreate([
  { name: 'John' },
  { name: 'Jane' },
  { name: 'Pete' }
]).success(function() {
  User.destroy('`name` LIKE "J%"').success(function() {
    // We just deleted all rows that have a name starting with "J"
  })
})
```

#### [FEATURE] Added convenient data types

Costent added support for advanced data types. For example, you are now able to define a column as unsigned, zerofilled integer having a length of 6:

```js
var User = sequelize.define("user", {
  streetNumber: Sequelize.INTEGER(6).ZEROFILL.UNSIGNED
})
```

Also we have added `BIGINT`, `DECIMAL`, `ENUM`, `ARRAY` and some other things. [They are nicely documented over here.](http://sequelizejs.com/documentation#models-data-types)

#### [FEATURE] Binary is more verbose now
[Rob Fletcher](https://github.com/terraflubb) made the Sequelize binary a bit more talkative, when it comes to errors or misusage.

#### [FEATURE] Promises/A support
