Since some weeks `v2.0.0` of the library is available. Its important to know that this release isn't actively developed but the sum of all the changes of the yet to be developed upcoming versions `v1.7.0`, `v1.8.0` and probably some further ones. Also all the backwards compatibility breaking changes are part of `v2.0.0`.

This post will explain the plans for upcoming releases and already implemented and released BC breaking changes in the latest version.

#### Upcoming releases

When you take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize#roadmap), you'll see that there are plans for upcoming minor releases of the `1.x.x` branch. Those milestones are meant to complete functionality of the current code base. However, we have noticed in the last weeks, that there are critical issues that need to be fixed, but which are breaking the backwards compatibility of the project, such as asynchronous validations. Because of that, all the BC breaking changes will be part of the `2.0.0` alpha versions.

#### Current state of the 1.7.0 alpha version (1.7.0-alpha2)

Here is a list of features that are available in the current version of `1.7.0`:
